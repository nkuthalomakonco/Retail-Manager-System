# Retail-Manager-System
Retail Manager System This software was created through 'TimCo Retail Manager', a course available on YouTube by Tim Corey.

Goals
• Demonstrate modern development techniques.
• Model how an application grows over time.
• Create a platform that needs to be upgraded to newer technologies.
• Create a platform to demonstrate how to incorporate new techniques or tools into existing
software.
• Create a hands-on learning tool for developers to simulate a real work environment.
Situation Step
In this simulation, we work for TimCo Enterprise Solutions. We build solutions that we can then
sell to clients. Right now, we have been assigned to build a retail management system. Over time,
we will get new requirements or entirely new work, just like a real job.
Initial Project
We have to build a desktop app that:
• Runs a cash register
• Handles inventory
• Manages the entire store
To allow it to grow, we will also be creating a Web API layer.
Initial Plan
We’re building an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that we can expand over time. The first steps
include:
• Git on Azure DevOps
• SQL Database (using SSDT - SQL Server Data Tools)
• Web API with authentication (MS Identity)
• WPF Application that can log in to the API
