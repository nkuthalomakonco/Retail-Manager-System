Retail Management System — TimCo Enterprise Solutions
🎯 Goals

Demonstrate modern development techniques

Model how an application grows over time

Create a platform that can be upgraded to newer technologies

Demonstrate how to incorporate new techniques or tools into existing software

Provide a hands-on learning tool for developers to simulate a real work environment

🧩 Situation

In this simulation, we work for TimCo Enterprise Solutions, a company that builds software solutions to sell to clients.

Our current project is to build a retail management system. Over time, we will receive new requirements and feature requests—just like in a real-world development environment.

🏗️ Initial Project

We need to build a desktop application that can:

Run a cash register

Handle inventory

Manage the entire store

To support future scalability, we’ll also create a Web API layer.

🚀 Initial Plan (MVP)

We’re building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that can expand over time.
The first steps include:

Set up Git on Azure DevOps

Create a SQL Database (using SSDT – SQL Server Data Tools)

Build a Web API with authentication (Microsoft Identity)

Develop a WPF Application that connects and logs in to the API

🧱 Tech Stack

Frontend: WPF (.NET)

Backend: ASP.NET Web API

Database: SQL Server (SSDT)

Authentication: Microsoft Identity

Version Control: Azure DevOps (Git)
